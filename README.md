# Book Exercises
In this repository I am replicating the codes for different Machine Learning books. 
You will find that some of the scripts have notes/comments. This are to guide me on the understanding of what it is being asked in the exerices/chapter.
You will find some "spanglish", do not hesitate to ask me for any doubts.
This is more of a personal exercise, than an explanation for people. I will try in the future to develop more clearly my understandings of the concepts. 
Enjoy!
